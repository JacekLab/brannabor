A bike of Kazimierz Nowak, the traveller

Kazimierz Nowak travelled through Africa between 1931 and 1936, mainly on his bike. 
He inspired me to draw this vector graphic. The plan is to animate it with a human silhouette and african landscapes moving in the background. 
Such animation could be a banner for a site about this humble and wise person, that I plan to create at some point.
